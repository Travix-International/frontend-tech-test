# Travix test

Travix Front-End Tech Interview Test 

# Introduction

The aim of the test is to develop a mini-application for managing TODO tasks.

Using your application we must be able to create, modify and delete a task.

A really simple server has been implemented with Express. It offers the minimum of expected functionalities (get the list of tasks, update a task, delete a task, save a task).

However this server is not perfect. It could be improved and tested as well.

So your mission is to develop the front-end from scratch using a famous front-end framework.

We are also expecting from you a usable, responsive UI.
