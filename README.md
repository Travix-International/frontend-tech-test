Travix Front-End Tech Interview Test 

# Introduction

This is my proposal for a TODO task managing application.

I used React and SASS to implement the interface and Redux to realize the data flow.

I modified the Express server a bit: I modified some functionalities, added other and fixed some bugs I found.

I added pagination to handle large tasks files. Honestly, I should have done it better graphically and put it into separated components, but it was the last thing I've done, it was late at night, I had little time, blabla. No excuses, I just wanted to show the approach.

I have implemented the configuration for unit testing, however, since I don't have much direct experience with Jest and Enzyme APIs and I didn't have much time to look deeper into them, I have just implemented some examples of unit test.
