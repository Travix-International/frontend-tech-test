# Travix test

Travix Front-End Tech Interview Test 

# Introduction

This is my proposal for a TODO task managing application.

I used React and SASS to implement the interface and Redux to realize the data flow.

I modified the Express server a bit: I simplified some functionalities and fixed a bug I found within the delete endpoint.

I have implemented the configuration for unit testing, however, since I don't have much experience with Jest and Enzyme APIs I have just implemented one example of unit test.

# Instructions

Run npm start and go to http://localhost:8080/
