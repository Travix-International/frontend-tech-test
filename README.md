# Travix test

Hi! This is my solution for Travix Front-End Tech Interview Test.

It was made with:
- React
- Redux, Redux Form and Redux Thunk
- Sass
- Cors to avoid cors error since I was starting to servers from the origin

# Things to improve

It would be great to add a "done" state for the tasks.

Improve the UI with some animations

# Usage

First you will need to install the dependencies for the client, run:
`cd client`

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Then you need to install the servers dependencies, run:

`cd ..` to go back to the root

`npm install` or `yarn install`

And finally, you can start the server and the client running:

`npm start` or `yarn start`


Thank you!
