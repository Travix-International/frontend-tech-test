Travix Front-End Tech Interview Test

# Introduction

The aim of the test is to develop a mini-application for managing TODO tasks.

Using your application we must be able to create, modify and delete a task.

A really simple server has been implemented with Express. It offers the minimum of expected functionalities (get the list of tasks, update a task, delete a task, save a task).

However this server is not perfect. It could be improved and tested as well.

So your mission is to develop the front-end from scratch using a famous front-end framework.

We are also expecting from you a usable, responsive UI.

# Instructions and notes

* Use node.js version 6.11.4 or higher
* Install dependencies with:`npm install`
* Start server with: `npm run server:start`
* Open a second terminal and start frontend with: `npm run webapp:start`
* Play around with this beautiful app ;)
* Then you can start running all tests by doing: `npm test`
* All frontend files are in `webapp/`

# Requirements

* React 14+
* Redux or Flux or Frint or whateverelse with a one-way data flow
* SASS or LESS
* Must be responsive
* We have big tasks files for testing the application (very huge)

# Bonus

* unit-tests for the UI
* integration-test (one (or more) just in order to show that you know what is it (: )
* evolution - unit-tests for the server
* dynamic-ui (web-sockets...?)
* using the `made in Travix` technologies
* ... Impress us !
