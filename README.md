Travix Front-End Tech Interview Test - Shaurya Sinha Submission

# Preamble

Before you begin to peruse my project, please go through the following readme to contextualize my approach on creating the app.

# Project roadmap

Before I began to create the project, I made a project roadmap. This roadmap was mapped out in an Agile fashion, listing out all the user stories required, a project timeline broken down by day and my achievable tasks for the day.

This was extremely important as
* I had limited time (1 week) to complete the Project
* I am also currently working full time as a dev
* I have not coded in React in over a year, so I had to budget time to learn

Initially, I had also intended on writing tests for the project. However since I haven't coded in React for over a year and am not at all familiar with React + Redux testing, I had to sacrifice that bonus feature. Instead, I opted to showcase my working skills via a project plan, implement Material UI for animations and deploy onto heroku
