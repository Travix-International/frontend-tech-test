# Travix test

Travix Front-End Tech Interview Test - Shaurya Sinha Submission

# Preamble

Before you begin to peruse my project, please go through the following readme to contextualize my approach on creating the app.

# Project roadmap

Before I began to create the project, I made a project roadmap. This roadmap was mapped out in an Agile fashion, listing out all the user stories required, a project timeline broken down by day and my achievable tasks for the day.

This was extremely important as
* I had limited time (1 week) to complete the Project
* I am also currently working full time as a dev
* I have not coded in React in over a year

# Installation

* ```npm install && npm install --prefix frontend ```

* React 15+
* Redux or Flux or [FrintJS](https://frint.js.org) or other alternatives that implement a unidirectional data flow
* SASS or LESS
* Must be responsive
* We have big tasks files for testing the application (very huge)

# Bonus

* unit-tests for the UI
* integration-test (one (or more) just in order to show that you know what is it (: )
* evolution - unit-tests for the server
* dynamic-ui (web-sockets...?)
* using the `made in Travix` technologies
* ... Impress us!
