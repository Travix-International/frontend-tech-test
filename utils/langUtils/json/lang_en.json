  "about_content": "The aim of the test is to develop a mini-application for managing TODO tasks. Using your application we must be able to create, modify and delete a task. A really simple server has been implemented with Express. It offers the minimum of expected functionalities (get the list of tasks, update a task, delete a task, save a task). However this server is not perfect. It could be improved and tested as well. So your mission is to develop the front-end from scratch using a front-end framework. We are also expecting from you a usable, responsive UI.",
